# Oh Snap! It me. 

My name is William M. Riley (He/They) and this is my site! On this github repo, I have multiple branches that serve as different versions of my site throughout the years. The current one uses Eleventy. 

I also have a few branches that use Stencil compiled components within certain frameworks, like Angular, React, Svelte, and Vue... with more to come!
