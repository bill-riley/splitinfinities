			p.fs6.lh-copy.white I love making things come to life in the browser. Iâ€™m super comfortable working with Node, Ruby, PHP, HTML, React, Vue, ES6+, TypeScript, and my favorite plain ol&rsquo; CSS. and I&rsquo;m learning Go ðŸ˜±. I love building interfaces, apps, and websites. Whether itâ€™s a simple, performant marketing site or a big, fancy interface talking to multiple APIs - that&rsquo;s my&nbsp;jam.

			p.fs6.lh-copy.white A great idea can be easy to come by, but it&rsquo;s always hard to make a reality. It involves planning, conversations, and sketching. Verifying that you have a clear idea of the problems you want to solve is what strategy is all about. I have plenty of experience finding and solving problems that improve the big ass numbers like acquisition, retention, and engagement. Let&rsquo;s get that MRR&nbsp;up!!&nbsp;ðŸ“ˆ

			p.fs6.lh-copy.white When I&rsquo;m doing UI Design, I&rsquo;m focused on making a cohesive design language. I lead with design systems, because I try really hard to make sure I&rsquo;m using reusable, realistic, and testable components. I make a design system for every frontend&nbsp;project.
